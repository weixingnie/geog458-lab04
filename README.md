# Lab 4: Tile Map

This project is focusing on the airports in the US. In this project, we are
going to demonstrate the use of tile map and a zoomable map on web. If
there is an air airport in the states, a dot with color is going to appear on the map. Each dot represents one airport on the records. All of our libraries are from open source softwares like leafet.
These dataset are provided by Professor Bo zhao.

In this map, we design a basic zoom levels of 5. Due to the limitation of github and our general design idea, we consider the data that shall be presented on a large scale to illustrate a clear impression of airports in the US. The wide range of documented airports from Alaska all the way to NY, which is across the whole North America continent. For the tiles, we decided to use a deep blue color to create a high contrast to our data points. The tiles are broken into 5 different zoomable levels. Personally, I would love to do a connection demonstration between airlines and COVID-19. With the knowledge of tile map, I might be able to experiment it in the future.

Thank you for reading this project. Have a wonderful day.
